# CSE464-wdiamon1
Course Project Part 2

Requirements:
Java 11
Graphviz
Maven
Intellij

Summary:

This project implements a basic graph manager in 
Java that supports adding nodes, adding edges, 
retrieving neighbors, and searching for a path between two 
nodes using either BFS or DFS. Two branches (bfs and dfs) 
were created to implement each algorithm separately, and a 
merge conflict was intentionally generated and resolved by 
combining the features into a single API using an Algorithm enum.
